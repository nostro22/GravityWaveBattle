GravityWaveBattle:

GravityWaveBattle is a local multiplayer game developed using Unity in 2019. The game was designed as a final project for a Game Development course at the Camara Argentina de Comercio.

The central premise of the game involves battling ships inside a water sphere. The ships' movements are continuous, and losing occurs when a ship collides with a pillar or gets hit with a cannonball. The environment consists of pillars, primarily underwater, which reflect bullets when hit and rise to the surface. As the battle progresses and the pillars rise the arena become more complex to navigate.

Key concepts in the development of GravityWaveBattle include:

Navigation within the sphere using physics: The game uses Unity's physics engine to simulate realistic movement and interactions within the water sphere.

Random environment generation: The game includes a system for generating the underwater environment randomly. This adds an element of unpredictability to the gameplay, as the battle arena changes with each game session.

Multiplayer audio source development: One of the most interesting aspects of the game's development was the creation of a multiplayer audio source. This involved using mathematical functions to calculate the average distance between players and adjusting the audio source based on specific actions visualstudio.microsoft.com.

The game development process involved using Visual Studio 2019, a recommended IDE for Unity game development. It offers world-class debugging features, which were essential in the development of GravityWaveBattle.

GravityWaveBattle showcases advanced Unity concepts such as collision detection, user input reception, player movements. It also features sound effects, background music, and particle effects to enhance the gaming experience.
